            <h2>WHAT IS MACHINE LEARNING?</h2>
            <p>
                Let's divide these two words, one is a machine and another one is learning. We all know about machine and
                learning as separate words but when these two words join what will be the meaning of the resultant word? The
                answer is “Making a <b>machine</b> to <b>learn</b>”. Darwinian evolutionary theory states that <b>“Survival
                    of the fittest”</b>.
                I hope you all have crossed this phase in your life at least once. What does the word ”fittest” in the
                phrase state? Does it mean physical fitness? No! It means the “knowledge” gained out of learning. Thus
                learning helps us to survive in this world.
                <blockquote>
                    “Machine learning is the process of making machines to learn the past, improve from experience and
                    predict
                    the future ”
                </blockquote>
            </p>
    
            <h2>WHY MACHINE LEARNING?</h2>
            <p>
                Now, there will be a question, <b>Why should machines learn?</b> There is a simple answer, ask the same
                question to
                yourself! Why should you learn? There may be many answers, one of the answers is, To carry out certain
                tasks, right?. The same answer is also for the previous question. The important thing is, a normal human
                with an IQ (intelligence quotient) level of 85 and 115 (average cases) can carry out small tasks but the
                <b>amount of data</b> we <b>produce every day</b> is truly mind-boggling. There are 2.5 quintillion bytes of
                <b>data</b> created
                <b>each day</b> at our current pace, but that pace is only accelerating with the growth of the <b>
                    Internet of Things(IoT)
                </b> so, a normal human can't analyze this quantity of data that's why machines come in!
            </p>
            <h2>HOW MACHINE LEARNING WORKS?</h2>
            <p> We all know how class tests are conducted, The portions for our test must be given. We will prepare the
                portions. There will be a set of questions framed by the staff since he/she is the person who framed the
                questions he/she must have known the answers. Now the most interesting phase of slip test comes -
                Evaluation, this will measure the performance of you.
                The same applies to machines.There are some phases through which machine learning works,
                <ul>
                    <li>PREPROCESSING DATA (portions for our test)</li>
                    <li>TRAINING (preparation for slip test)</li>
                    <li>TESTING (writing slip test)</li>
                    <li>PERFORMANCE MEASURE (evaluation)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>TYPES OF DATA:</h2>
            <p>
                Since we are about to work with data, let's know about the types of data. There are two major types of data,
                one
                is categorical and another one is numerical.
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            Categorical: (QUALITATIVE DATA)
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            The data which can be divided into categories or groups is called categorical data. For example,
                            gender, level
                            of education, animal name, brand name etc,..
                            It is also called qualitative data -
                            Qualitative data are measures of 'types' and may be represented by a name, symbol, or a number code.
                            Categorical data gets further classified into two types,
                            <ol>
                                <li>Nominal:Nominal scales are used for labeling variables, without any quantitative value.
                                    For example:
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>male, female (Gender)</li>
                                        <li>Black,brown,blonde (Hair color)</li>
                                    </ol>
        
                                </li>
                                <li>Ordinal:In Ordinal scales, order of the values is significant, but difference between those
                                    values
                                    are unknown.For example : satisfaction, happiness, discomfort.
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>
                            Numerical:(QUANTITATIVE DATA)
                        </h4>
                        <p>The data which can be measured is called numeric data. For example, age, salary, tenure etc,. It
                            is also called
                            <b>QUANTITATIVE data</b> -
                            Quantitative data are measures of values or counts and are expressed as numbers. Quantitative
                            data are data
                            about numeric variables (e.g. how many; how much; or how often).
    
                            Numerical data gets further classified into two types,
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Discrete</b>:Discrete Data can only take certain values. Example: the number of
                                    students in a class. We can't
                                    have half a student!</li>
                                <li><b>Continuous</b>:Continuous Data can take any value (within a range).Example:Time in a
                                    race( you could even
                                    measure it to fractions of a second).</li>
                            </ul>
    
                            <br>
    
                            <b>Ungrouped data(Raw data)</b> typically refers to tables of data where each row contains an
                            observation and each
                            column represents a variable that describes some property of each observation. Data in this
                            format is sometimes
                            referred to as tidy data, flat data, primary data, atomic data, and unit record data. <br><br>
    
                            <b>Grouped data</b> From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Grouped data are data formed by
                            aggregating individual
                            observations of a variable into groups, so that a frequency distribution of these groups serves
                            as a convenient
                            means of summarizing or analyzing the data. <br><br>
    
                            <b>Primary data</b>: Data collected by the investigator himself/ herself for a specific purpose.
                            Examples: Data
                            collected by a student for his/her thesis or research project.
                            <br><br>
                            <b>Secondary data</b>: Data collected by someone else for some other purpose (but being utilized
                            by the investigator
                            for another purpose).
