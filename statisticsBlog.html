                    Wondering how Statistics plays a dominant role in the life of Data scientist, Machine Learning Engineer
                    as well in our day-to-day routine. Let’s dive to mystify this through learning and experiencing the
                    Statistics.
                </p>
                <p>To begin with “What Statistics is? “, Let me make you clear with the differences that lie between
                    Statistics and Probability. The Probability generally gives you the percentage of the event which is
                    likely going to occur. While Statistics helps you to put forth a conclusion and allows to draw
                    interpretations about the event</p>
                <h5>
                    “Statistics is a branch of mathematics that deals with drawing conclusion to the data, which is either
                    quantitative or categorical. In addition to that Statistics is a magical tool that makes number speak.”
                </h5>
                <h3>1.2 TYPES OF STATISTICS:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Broadly Statistics can be categorized into two types as Descriptive and Inferential Statistics. Yet
                    practically speaking none of them can be given more importance either both should be considered as
                    highly vital.

                    <li><b>Descriptive statistics</b> <p>
                        gives the form and shape to the raw data. It’s like preparing base for your
                            delicious creamy cake .Without base of a cake one cannot add cream and toppings to make it more
                            tastier. Likewise, the raw data is not sufficient to proceed with further processes to provide
                            meaningful insights. It is also tough to do visualizations with raw data. For these reasons
                            Descriptive statistics has to be done with the aid of two statistic measures given below:
                    </p>
    
                        <h4>
                            MEASURES OF CENTRAL TENDENCY:
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Measure of Central Tendency usually identifies the central position of the given dataset. It usually
                            summarizes the data and hence takes the other name as Summary statistics. It includes Mean, Median,
                            Mode which will be explained in a clear-cut way in the following sections.
                        </p>
                        <h4>
                            MEASURES OF DISPERSION:
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Measures of Dispersion summarizes the data by process of knowing the spread of the data around the
                            central position (Measures of Central Tendency). It involves Standard Deviation , Variance, Range
                            and Quartiles which will be explored in following blogs.

                        <b>Inferential Statistics :</b> Hope now the question marks about Descriptive Statistics are answered where
                            both Measures of Central tendency and Dispersion involves the entire dataset (Population) into
                            consideration while Inferential Statistics doesn’t involve the Population but involves only the part
                            of it (Sample) that effectly represents the population.
